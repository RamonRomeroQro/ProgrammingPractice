For Unix-like systems (bash and Python3)

## Challenge 1

Run inputs from resources spicified in pdf, stored in ``` ./challenge1/inputs/ ```

```
$ cd challenge1
$ ./run.sh
```

The outputs will be stored in in ``` ./challenge1/outputs/ ```

OR

Load JSON-API Response from cli

``` 
$ cd challenge1
$ python3 program.py [path_to_json]
```
The outputs will be printed on the standard output console

### Observations

In the script (``` ./challenge1/program.py ```), the functions are defined and specified with it parameters and return types. The printed output is just for evaluation purposes.

## Challenge 2

Run inputs from resources spicified in pdf, stored in ``` ./challenge2/inputs/ ```

``` 
$ cd challenge2
$ ./run.sh
```
The outputs will be stored in in ``` ./challenge2/outputs/ ```

OR

Load JSON-API Response from cli

``` 
$ cd challenge2
$ python3 program.py [path_to_json]
```
The outputs will be printed on the standard output console


### Observations

The ``` pretty print (pprint) ``` is just for evaluation purposes. In the script (``` ./challenge2/program.py ```), the function is defined and specified with its parameters and return type.
